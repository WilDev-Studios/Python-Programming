# Python Programming Tutorial
This tutorial is going to teach the basics of Python programming

## Need to Know
- `CPython` is just the actual name of the Python language, meaning it was programming using the `C` language
- This tutorial is going to be focused on version `3.10.7`
- We are going to be using `Windows 10` during our installation process, but it should be not much different using other operating systems
- When we reference an `IDE` we are talking about an `Integrated Development Environment`. This is literally just a more advanced text editor, so if you are really dedicated to using `Notepad++` then you may do so...although we don't recommend it.
- We are going to be using `Visual Studio Code` for our preferred `IDE`
