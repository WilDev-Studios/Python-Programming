# Downloading Python
In order for us to program in Python, we need to, well, have Python!

We will be using `Python 3.10.7` in this tutorial, but it should be very similar throughout versions.

First go to the [Python installation page](https://www.python.org) and select the `Download Python *version*` box (make sure your operating system and bit count is proper to your computer (like x32 and x64).
This should start the download of Python.

Once it is downloaded, you want run it to install it.
When you land on a page that says "Install Python *version* (64/32-bit)":
- Select the "Add Python *version* to PATH" checkbox at the bottom.
- This will add this Python version to your system's PATH making it easy for your computer to run Python programs
- Select the "Install Now" option in the top-center.
- This will install `pip` (Python's package manager) and Python itself.
- Just wait for it to finish then open up your command prompt (cmd) or terminal (if on mac)

In your command prompt, type "python -V" to get what version of Python you have installed
If everything was done correctly, the console should say "Python *version*"
