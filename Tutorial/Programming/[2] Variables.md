# Variables - Python Programming
In order for programmers to manipulate and use data, we want to save the data into "storage boxes" called `variables`

A variable is quite simply a box with a name and a value.

Let's say we have a cardboard box named `appleCount`.
Inside of this box we have 6 apples inside.

This box is considered to be a variable.

Let's actually put this into a program:
```python
appleCount = 6
```

It's very simple, right?
Yes.

A variable is just putting a name to a value. Instead of repeatedly stating a value, we can reference that value by it's name.
We can access a variable's value just by calling the variable name:
```python
appleCount = 6 # Makes the "appleCount" variable have the value of 6

print(6) # Prints 6
print(appleCount) # Also prints 6
