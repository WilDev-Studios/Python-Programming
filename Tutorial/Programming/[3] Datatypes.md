# Datatypes - Python Programming
In order to actually use the Python programming language to it's full potential, we need to know what kind of potential it has, obviously enough.

We can categorize different types of data into objects called `datatypes`

Here's the basic datatypes that most programmers will always use:
```python
# Text datatypes
str (string) - Can be a character ('A') or a sequence of characters ("Hello this is a sentence")

# Number datatypes
int (integer) - Can be any number without a decimal (1, -56) 
float (floating point) - Can be any number (int or 0.32532, -103)

# Conditional datatypes
bool (boolean) - Can be either `True` or `False`

# Immutable (unchangeable) datatypes
tuple - A sequence of different values that cannot be changed such as: ("Hello", "World") or (1, 5)

# Mutable (changeable) datatypes
list (a.k.a. array) - A sequence of different values that can be changed such as: ["Hello", "world"] or [1, 0]
dict (dictionary) (a.k.a. hashmap) - A sequence of different keys and values that can be changed such as: {"Word 1": "Hello", "Word 2": "World"}
```
